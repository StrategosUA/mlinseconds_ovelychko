RK: Looking for people for new batch.
    We will start once we get around 30 people committed. We will be dropping people who suddenly realize that they have no time.
    Req:
    python knowledge
    5-15 hours per week of study time
    Comment if interested
    Please read in first comment feedback from people who will graduate soon to set up your expectations
      
RK: Details for the program
    Program will be 6-9 weeks long. Every week we will be solving one toy problem. 
    The idea behind each problem is to practice one or more machine learning technics. 
    At the end of every week we will drop some people who does not have time/very interested by now is super busy/etc
    Once we will be done with a toy problems. We will have 3 people left and we will do kaggle competition for one month. 
    With idea to apply deep machine learning to the problem.

RK: At this point, please share your git commit with solution for hello xor. 
    Also write down your work log. Write down what you tried, what worked and what did not work. 
    How much time you spend on what and what was improvement from it. Write down your pain points and how you overcome them
