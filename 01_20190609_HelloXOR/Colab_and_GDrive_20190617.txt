GET STARTED

As I have very outdated notebook I want to study in cloud. There is a way of cloning git directly to colab, but looks like it is uploaded only for session. 
My saved version of model wasn't accesible next day, so I was looking for a way to save results in my GDrive.

Created folder in my GDrive for ML course and copied there Roman's git:

- downloaded his git as zip-file,
- uploaded to my GDrive.
Also there are ways to clone git directly to GDrive, but they require more relying on desktop.

## 1.Preparing for work

# Load the Drive helper and mount
from google.colab import drive

# This will prompt for authorization.
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Return the current working directory path.
!pwd

# Target dir in my case is /content/drive/My Drive/ML/mlinseconds
%cd drive/My Drive/ML/mlinseconds

# Return the current working directory path (if there is need to check)
!pwd

# Run problem file AS IS before adjusting model
!python -m mlis.problems.helloXor

# Open file
!cat mlis/problems/helloXor.py

# Copy contents of the file above, paste to new Colab cell and add at the beginning the line of code which specifies where to save your adjusted version.
# %%writefile mlis/problems/helloXor_ADJUSTED.py


## 2. Editing helloXor script

#a place where to save your adjusted version
%%writefile mlis/problems/helloXor_ADJUSTED.py

# Run problem file AFTER adjusting model
!python -m mlis.problems.helloXor_ADJUSTED
