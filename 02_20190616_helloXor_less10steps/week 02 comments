My worklog during week was not linear:

Monday 10 - Friday 14 were spent to read theory and crawling through helloxor, solutionmanager and gridsearch code.
No tangible improvement :(
The main misunderstanding was in tweaking only 2 hyperparameters - lr and hidden size.

Saturday 15 hint from Roman to try grid search for every possible parameter moved me forward from dead point. 
Hint from Anrii Skrypchenko showed me how to construct it in code.

Progress:
tuning lr and hs gave me 100 minimum steps
loss function 100->66
momentum 66->35
activtion function 35->7
